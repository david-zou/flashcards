There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Obento

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Flashcard memorization tool made fun and effortless.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  For users who prioritize convenience and accessibility, Obento is an online learning tool that allows them to create flashcard decks enhanced with rich media and explore existing decks created by others. Unlike Quizlet and other popular flashcard applications, Obento is the only one fully integrated with voice-activated control and hands-free interaction. Now, users can access their Bentos (decks) of Noris (cards) anywhere anytime.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Flashcards are most effective when they are used repeatedly to reinforce memorization, but they can be cumbersome and tedious to use for people with active lifestyles. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Obento integrates voice-activated control, hands-free interaction, rich media, and a snappy interface to create the modern day flashcard experience. Now, users can access their Bentos (decks) of Noris (cards) anywhere anytime.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Welcome to Obento! We guarantee this is the most fun you'll have using flashcards."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Start your Obento experience by searching for an existing bento or creating your own.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Memorizing things has always been my weak point, so I usually write down the things I need in flash cards and reshuffle them to reinforce my memory. After using this product I was able to remember them much better than normal flash cards, being able to talk it out loud and have it verified provided more stimuli and context for me to remember things." -Josh Van B.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
